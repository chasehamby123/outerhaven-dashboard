// BDC loans rules: which BDC-financed private companies are worth Peter's call. Pure JS (no imports) so HQ and tests can read it.
// Input: a bdc_signals row (scripts/bdc_signals.py). Every verdict stores its reasons.
// Size (Tengku, 8 Oct 2026): under $10M of debt wastes Peter's time; over ~$150M the big banks and placement agents take it.
// $10-75M is the core (~$2-17M EBITDA at the usual 4-5.5x leverage), $75-150M the upper end.
// v2: weights rescaled after the first live run (half the targets scored 100, so the score didn't rank anything).
// v3: a maturity that passed AFTER the lenders' last report is unknown (extended, refinanced or defaulted), not 'still outstanding';
// stressed loans show the refinancing gap (debt minus the lenders' own value), which a plain refinancing can't close.
// v4 (12 Oct 2026, Tengku: Global Integrated Flooring was No. 1 and shouldn't have been): two lanes, scored separately.
//   'refi' = the company refinances a performing loan and hires us (outreach to the company). Distress is no longer a plus here.
//   'loan_sale' = marked under 85¢, non-accrual, or past due and marked down: the lender decides, so Peter pitches the BDC to sell
//   the loan. Needs Peter's $20M minimum (loan buyers want size). Too late (< 4 months to maturity) = the lender is already negotiating.
//   Owner found by search (s.owner, signal-contacts) = not founder-owned: the owner runs the refinancing, so refi drops to maybe.
// v5 (12 Oct 2026, Tengku: Datalink at 42 days and 72¢ sat in the loan-sale top 3): a loan maturing in under 4 months can't be sold in
//   time (NDA, diligence and settlement take 4-8 weeks; the lender and owner are already negotiating), so it's Maybe in both lanes.
//   Lenders count by manager, not by fund (BCP Investment + BC Partners Lending = one seller). Scores shown out of 100 = points ÷ the
//   lane's maximum (refi 69, loan sale 78); verdicts are decided on the points, so rescaling changes no verdict and no order.
// v6 (12 Oct 2026, TAUC Management = Total Access Urgent Care, owned by ICV Partners; search on "TAUC" found nothing): no owner found
//   no longer scores (+5 "possibly founder-owned" removed, refi max 64); it's a Check line instead.
