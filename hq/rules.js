// Rules page (#/rules, admin): every qualification rule behind the signal tabs, in plain words, with the same
// Need / Risk / Fit / Check / Cut labels the tabs use. Written from the rules files on the server:
//   supabase/functions/bdc-signals/rules.js (BDC_RULES_VERSION 6), fund-signals/rules.js (classifyCredit v4, fund v15),
//   ucc-signals/rules.js (UCC_RULES_VERSION 4). When a rule changes there, change it here in the same commit.
